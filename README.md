# FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION USING HOG EXTRACTOR AND CNN MODEL
The main idea of this project is to prediict the emotion from the face on real time. And to achieve this goal we start by training a model and try to evaluate it.
To train the model, we used Fer2013 datset that contains 30,000 images of facial expressions grouped in seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral.
First, we try to use a Hand-crafted method wich is the Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) 
Second, we create CNN from scratch and train the model
finaly, we create a model which contains the two features( HOG features and CNN features)
